# Image_Classification
In this repository we use some ct images(3D) from kidney and try to classify them in three classes.
<br>Our classification is based on Tstage cancer that is related to the size of tumor.
<br>The first dataset had 300 images and labels based on Monai transformers we made synthetic data and finally we had 1516 images for training model.
<br>For preprocessing our dataset we used Monai library too.
<br>We used **efficientnet-b7**, the state of the art architecture for image classification.
