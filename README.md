# Image_Classification
In this repository we use some ct images(3D) from kidney and try to classify them in three classes.
<br>Our classification is based on Tstage cancer that is related to the size of tumor.
<br>The first dataset had 300 images and labels based on codes we made synthetic data and finally we had 1512 images.
<br>For preprocessing our dataset we used Monai library.
